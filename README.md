# MavenManyToOneDemo
Using Chatgpt to help create a backend Project with Maven Framework.
Displaying knowledge for HTTP Request handling.
Unit testing, Database configuration, SQL/ relational database management. 
Planning to create more backend projects but switch into SpringBoot Framework. 
The goal for this project was to demonstrate my understanding to an extent of what 
Springboot is doing in the background when configuring a project with the developer tags.
